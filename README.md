# FPGA
FPGA project for the control system of the OAM experiment. FPGA stores a set of images in a DDR memory, displays such images via HDMI port, prepares a train of short pulses to drive an EOM Intensity modulator, and aquires counts from 2 detectors. This project is meant to work along a GUI written in C#.
